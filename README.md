# objectCaptureOverview

This repository primarily showcases an iOS app I developed to assist my lab in collecting image datasets. 
It includes usage instructions and documentation. 
However, due to lab confidentiality, not all code details can be made public. 
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my experience in iOS app development.
Please refer to the introduction repository if any details.
